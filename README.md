# ts-validate-json-schema
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Blu-J/ts-validate-json-schema/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/Blu-J/ts-validate-json-schema?branch=master)
The problem that we want solved is that we have generated out some JSON-Schema, but we would like the types in typescript. As well, we would like to validate these types are valid (throw/ case switch).

So this is going to be a subset of the potential json schema. If I can't get a typescript type from the schema, then I'm not going to make the validation.
If you want to have full validation, but no typescript types, something like [AJV.js](https://ajv.js.org/) is going to fit your bill better.

## Example Usuage

```ts
// Here we have brought in the test schema. This schema was cloned off 
// https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step.html
// except the reference. 
// Notice: There is the `as const`. Currenlty one cannot import from csv with the const
const testSchema = {
    $schema: "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
    $id: "http://example.com/product.schema.json",
    title: "Product",
    description: "A product from Acme's catalog",
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      productId: {
        description: "The unique identifier for a product",
        type: "integer",
      },
      productName: {
        description: "Name of the product",
        type: "string",
      },
      isProduct: {
        description: "Name of the product",
        type: "boolean",
      },
      price: {
        description: "The price of the product",
        type: "number",
        exclusiveMinimum: 0,
      },
      tags: {
        description: "Tags for the product",
        type: "array",
        items: {
          type: "string",
        },
        minItems: 1,
        uniqueItems: true,
      },
      extras: {
        description: "Tags for the product",
        type: "array",
        minItems: 1,
        uniqueItems: true,
      },
      dimensions: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          length: {
            type: "number",
          },
          width: {
            type: "number",
          },
          height: {
            type: "number",
          },
        },
        required: ["length", "width", "height"],
      },
    },
    required: ["productId", "productName", "price"],
  } as const;

  // Here we create our matcher
  const matchTestSchema = asSchemaMatcher(testSchema);
  // If we want to pull out the generated type from the matcher for typescript
  type TestSchema = typeof matchTestSchema._TYPE;

  // Here we are going to create a json to test the shape
  const validShape = {
    productId: 0,
    price: 0.4,
    productName: "test",
    tags: ["5"],
    extras: ["string", 4],
    isProduct: false,
    dimensions: {
      length: 7.0,
      width: 12.0,
      height: 9.5,
    },
  };

  // So here, we are going to validate the shape.
  // Note: Return type of unsafeCast is TestSchema here, so we don't manually
  // need to tell typescript what the type is.
  // Note: If this fails with unsafeCast, it will throw. There are other methods in the validator that will not throw.
  const validShape: TestSchema = matchTestSchema.unsafeCast(validShape);

```
